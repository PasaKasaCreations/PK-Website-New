#### Section 2: Our Story

**Content Required:** Company origin story (3-4 paragraphs)

**Sample Content:**
```
"Pasakasa Creations was born from a simple belief: Nepal has incredible
tech talent that deserves world-class opportunities.

In 2017, our founders — a group of passionate game developers — started
building mobile games from a small office in Kathmandu. What began as a
hobby quickly grew into something bigger.

Our first game, Teen Patti Friends, reached 50,000 downloads in its first
year. Players loved the smooth gameplay and authentic experience. This
success validated our approach: build quality products that people actually
want to use.

But we noticed a problem. Aspiring developers in Nepal had limited access
to quality training. Most courses were outdated or purely theoretical.
So we decided to change that.

Today, Pasakasa Creations is both a game studio and a training academy.
We build games played by 100,000+ users worldwide, and we train the next
generation of developers through hands-on, industry-relevant courses."
